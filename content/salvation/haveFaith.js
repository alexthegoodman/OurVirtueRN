Who can describe faith with words?
    Can any language describe it?
Faith cannot be trapped in a bottle

Faith cannot be seen with the naked eye
    Only by what it touches and leaves behind
Might you possibly spot its presence

___

When faith is present in a person
    Can anybody put a stop to them?
Nay, except for momentary illusions

With faith, what is not possible for a person?
    One can heal in unexplainable ways
One can move the unmovable objects
    Indeed, with faith all things are possible

___

Faith is found in the good decisions of people
    Faith itself is an undoubtful belief in God
And knowing that He will do what you believe

The one who stands firm to the very end
    That is the one who Our Father notices
Definitely, He will not leave that one unfulfilled

___

Feelings and numbness
    Knowledge and ignorance
What can they do to faith?
    Do they have any power?

Perhaps it is the fire or the storm
    Which desires to overcome faith
Can even death overcome faith?
