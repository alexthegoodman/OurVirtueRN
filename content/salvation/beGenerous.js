What is life at all,
    If you have nothing to remember?
Why should a child have no where to turn,
    Crying out, “Father, help! God, save me!”

Words cannot describe the pain
    Even images cannot depict the horror
For suffering is a private experience

Let those with food eat it
    So that they may not be tired
Make them not lazy or over restful,
    Give them empathy for hardship

There is pain in the work
    There are struggles and costs
But be grateful amidst your pain
    And deliver relief to the others

Give your life by devoting it to giving back
    Lay it down by your work
And build God's Kingdom on Earth
    Taking part in the Salvation of Jesus

___

Come to God with wisdom
    Approach Him humbly

He does not lead all people
    The one who gets excited by money
Or the one full of dreams and fantasies
    About riches or fame or Earthly success

He shows love and uplifts His Chosen
    Who heed guidance selflessly
Who dream of giving back
    And expect nothing in return

Our Father will strengthen them,
    He will help and deliver them!

___

Give your provision, your resources
    Give your time, your knowledge

Be a knowledgeable servant
    Hide away from the public eye
Let your giving be in secret
    So God may reward you in Paradise
And your gift may be between you and Him

When a proper time arrives
    It is honorable to give one tenth
You needn't give more at any time
    But the one who gives all has a great faith
