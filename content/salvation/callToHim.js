The People are blessed with power
    Power to speak inwardly and to be heard
Our God listens to what is not spoken aloud
    And He knows when you acknowledge Him in your heart
It is a power called prayer, it is one of His great joys

Prayer should be honest and true
    He desires not that you hide from Him
Be genuine about your hardships
    Praying earnestly about your hopes and wishes
Be loving, giving Him your praise and thanks

Do not pray with many words
    One can speak to Him in a moment
Another may spend a while in stillness
    He listens to your heart, He knows what is unsaid

There are many different ways to pray
    But it is the genuine who Our Father always accepts

Pray not for riches
    Pray not for selfish gain
Our Father loves prayers to gain virtue
    He answers prayers which help others
The one who makes a prayer for the right things
    Only needs a dash of faith for it all to come true

One who calls out to the Creator longs for Him secretly
    He hears their cry and shows them mercy
Yet it is the loving time obeying His Gospel,
    And the regular prayer which grows your relationship

Our Father loves our dedicated time alone with Him
    Whether once, three, or five times a day
Give Him time in prayer, in worship, or in study
    Indeed, it is not too much, it is due Him
