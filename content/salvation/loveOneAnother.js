Jesus spoke God's Word
    And he gave commands from God
    Yet only few commands were given

To love your God is the greatest commandment
    One without wisdom can live by it
Our God exalts love above all knowledge

Indeed, love your Creator ahead of all things
    Truly He is your Father and looks after you
What can be more important than Him?
    He's the Good One who is always there for you

And love those who cross your path
    Have compassion for their hardship
Overlook their wrongs and help them
    For love is the most pleasing to your Father

___

Indeed, love is the most powerful force
    It can drive people across the whole earth
And love can heal a person's inner self
    So manifest love in its many forms
    And you will be greater than a monk or priest

___

Treat your opposers like friends
    Remind them their Creator loves them also

Indeed, Our God is greater than wars and grudges
    His Love is not hampered by our mutual grievances

___

Relieve the load for another
    And take on suffering as love
Labor for their health
    Give them your time
And what you value

This example Jesus set for us
    By giving his life so we could have ours

___

Pray for love in all your words
    Pray for love in all that you do

Speak pleasantly unto others
    Speak the truth
Be not two-faced
    Choose gentle words

Search out the light in people
    Find the good in what they do

Be empathetic out of your love
    Give thought to others feelings
Consider their perspectives
    Show you feel what they feel

___

Love may consist of doing good deeds
    Yet the deepest love is unconditional
Those with God's Love in their hearts,
    Give love without it being earned

Be not partial to anyone
    Give love to the unloved
Give attention to the forgotten
    Forgive the pariah
