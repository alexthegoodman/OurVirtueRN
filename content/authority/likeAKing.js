In God's Kingdom, the Kings are not rulers
    They place themselves beneath their people
In God's Kingdom, the Kings are like servants
    They seek after the benefit of their people

Indeed, Kings will face many adversities
    But Kings have the strength of devotion
They do not give up and survive many threats

So support those who humble themselves
    Seeking to do good and be helpful
For those ones will guide the people with heart

Remain on your guard against sinful leaders
    For they are slaves to sin and evil
They are not slaves of God or of people
