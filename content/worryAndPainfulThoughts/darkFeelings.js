Anger has snared countless people
    Indeed, the angry often feel justified
Yet one should be far from their anger
    For it will never serve anybody

Yet Satan's joys are often deceiving
    When people have a love for wealth,
    When they celebrate the loss of an enemy,
    Or when they dwell on the unfairness of life,
    And are overcome with envy

Truly, all of these things are abhorrent to God
    He is concerned only with goodness and truth
