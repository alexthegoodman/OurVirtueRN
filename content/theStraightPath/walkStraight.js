Hypocrites expect from others correct behavior
    But they do not practice it themselves
They condemn others for evil deeds
    But run when they are condemned likewise
They provide special allowances for some
    While others worthy of those privileges are denied
The hypocrites say, "Condemn him"
    But they lack foresight, and thereby condemn themselves

Those who are straight in their hearts and minds
    They have no inner conflict
    And they repent for their failings
Those who please God will tolerate what they dislike
    And they will practice what they believe in

Our God protects His loyal believers
    He lets nothing fall except what He allows
He holds up the straight and honest
    He shelters them from calamity
    And heals their inner diseases
