Recall when Our Savior humbled himself
    And showed his love and heart of forgiveness
By washing his disciple's feet by hand

Who can turn away from all wealth,
    And who can turn away from all power,
So that he could show his love to his people?

That is the love of Jesus Christ
    That is the value of a humble heart

So take not the high spot in your affairs
    Rather, take the low spot without fear
For this reflects your heart to God

And do not walk about in an overbearing way
    Do not be pretentious or egotistical
But let yourself appear as less than others

The humble cannot possibly stand before God
    For they consider themselves unworthy and incapable
Yet God is completely capable and always wins
