There was a time when
    A certain woman came to Jesus
She did a beautiful thing to him
    By pouring perfume on his head

Appreciation and gratefulness
    They come from the heart

Indifference shows a lack of understanding
    The scarcity of Earth, and the value of health
    How can they be disregarded?

Indeed, Jesus was grateful for his blessing
    Honoring her gift in front of all the others

The righteous will be grateful as well
    As Our Father watches in secret
