Judgement is not befitting of people
    Only Our Creator has complete knowledge
None can discern or comprehend likewise

Our Father gives the same choice to all
    Both the humble and the prideful
That they should judge or not

Indeed, Our Creator judges the one who judges
    Surely, like your dealings He shall deal with you
And by His judgement He gives out mercy

The person who judges by the surface
    An impression, a sound, or sight
Our Creator shall be just as harsh in return

Rather, be of correct judgement
    And do not exercise it often

___

All of us as brothers and sisters
    Expect events to come to pass
For others to treat us in a certain way
    And for one thing to mean another
These are merely expectations
    Which may not be correct at all
Until a conclusion must be drawn
    And a final judgement called

Be not surprised at these times
    When expectations are proven wrong
Indeed, judgement is tempting by way of surety
