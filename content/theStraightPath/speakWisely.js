Be mindful of your speech
    Words may lead people to peaceful destinations
And they have power to destroy decades of work

Remember what the wisest speakers do
    They hold their tongue and think carefully
They show prudence and speak less

Heed the guidance of Jesus Christ
    Listen to the Gospel's sayings on words of light

As for the petty sins
    Do not condemn them
For you are more alike
    With a humble heart and foresight 

As for the deeds of others
    Do not criticize them
Aim for higher ways, lighter ways
    Ask questions, make suggestions

Deception is perverse speech
    Lies mislead the decision makers
They trample on love and relations
    They create distrust between people

Making excuses for offenses
    Leads one blindly into hateful speech
Wise people take them lightly
    They are also mindful of people's feelings

Give in to no pressuring speech
    It is a friend of force, it is a foe to respect
