Jesus taught us to return hate with love
    Indeed, he blessed the peacemakers
For they are the Children of God

Peaceful ways are found by the selfless
    They are on the side of the truth
Those who quarrel and lead wars should be cast away
    And to the peaceful be granted all authority

They settle matters and seek compromise
    By God's guidance, they seek diplomacy
Revenge is far from them, unprofitable and in ruin

They surrender to their enemies
    And provide understanding for their wishes
They put their distaste to the side
    By tolerating that which they detest

They sow little disgruntlement
    By avoiding provocative words
And allow contrary opinions
    So that they may have peace with their own

Even harsh insults and ridicule
    It disturbs them not
    For they nurture peace ahead of themselves
