People have dirty hair and bodies
    They have disease and sicknesses
Even some hidden away within their hearts
    Put on them by what happened before

Others will turn away and become shy
    Those made similar to them have become estranged
For the Earth and its ways have overtaken them

Yet there is One who has overcome the World
    Our Master and Teacher, the Chosen One of God
It was Jesus who was called Doctor and Healer

He would touch the sick with open palms
    With unwashed hands He would eat food
And He would spend His time with sinners

Jesus would teach of Heavenly things few understood
    He spoke in parables which were too amazing to comprehend
Yet it was not the righteous but the sick who He spoke to

Do as Jesus commands and follow His Word with intention
    That is the way to God's wishes and pleasures
