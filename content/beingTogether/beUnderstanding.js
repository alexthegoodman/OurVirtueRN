Your brothers and sisters are weak like you
    They go astray from time to time

The understanding do not shun others
    They would not tell others how to feel
The understanding would not judge by their own deeds
    They would not expect others to act like themselves

God's Children show understanding
    Consider your background and past
Think of your hardships and weaknesses
    We are gentle and thoughtful of each other
