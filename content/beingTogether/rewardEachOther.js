God, Our Father has sent the Gospel
    He has called those in conflict to peace
And it is not the prosecution of your opposers
    That He desires you place your hopes on
Rather, place your thoughts on the next life
    And foresee the reward of His Children

Acknowledge a person's progress
    Give to them for their righteousness

Surely, when Jesus comes again
    He will reward everyone for their deeds

When one has only done what is expected
    Give them relief from their burdens
When one has proven himself trustworthy
    Provide him with privilege, and others likewise

Discipline is not the first choice of the wise
    A reward is always considered by the mindful
