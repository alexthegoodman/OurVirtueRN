Carrying the burdens of God is hard
    Even without those who seek your harm
Serving God closely brings on hate

You will find yourself with enemies
    They will scoff at you and belittle you
They will delegitimize you and set traps for you

Those who hate you may seek your harm
    They will exceed the bounds you expected
But do not turn towards hate or anger

Even when they are constant in their attacks
    When they are harsh and unrelenting
Pray to God, seek His strength, and persevere

Our Creator never forgets his faithful servants
    Have faith, and He will not leave you behind
