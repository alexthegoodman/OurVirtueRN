By His guiding words,
    Our Creator shaped the Earth
And by His Supreme Commands
    He determines what He wishes

Why fear losing along the way?
    Knowing your Father is with you

Be not afraid of anyone
    Not even of yourself
Few are capable of very much
    Except that it be stopped

Have courage and be brave
    Your Father will answer your call
And His knowledge is complete
    Glory and destruction in His design
Are both only 7 precise steps away

Amazing God, Who Heals People!
    Righteous Creator, Who Sends Rain!
