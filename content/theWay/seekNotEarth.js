People seek after life from the Earth
    The lifeless Earth beneath their feet
The perfume is for only a short time
    But your love should never decay
The fire lasts only a few hours
    But God's Love shall never fade

Our Father watches always
    Not a thought escapes His Sight
His Majesty is met with you
    Though billions roam the Earth
He cares for each morning
    And if you shall manifest His Ways
Your mornings shall be lovely indeed
