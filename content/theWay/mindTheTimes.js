Rituals bring a people closer together
    As habits they build solidarity
Exalted falsely as a means of salvation
    They carry burdens and relieve them also

When something is done regularly for God
    It only matters when done with heart
One who is genuine towards God pleases Him
    But one who obeys reluctantly should pray

The repentant wash before prayer 
    But the water does not save
The modest cover their heads
    But the clothing does not save

Your Creator does not require these rituals
    He desires the virtues in their hearts
So let your faith nurture itself within you
    Ask Your Father to lead you unto the honorable

___

Indeed, if you are blessed with knowledge
    You will be mindful of the times

Honor the people who rest routinely
    Every Sunday on the Sabbath Day
The people do not work for the sake of God
    Unless someone is in need of help

And honor those who watch the Moon
    In Ramadan is one month of fasting
Except in the early mornings
    And in the late evenings

Our Father has set out His vision
    In the Age to Come with peace on Earth
All the people will obey the One True God
    And believe in the one Messiah, Jesus Christ

Worship and Love your Creator!
    He gives Strength to the Weak!
