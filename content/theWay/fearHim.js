Yet remain on your guard
    Make sure you are self-aware
For Our God is always watching
    And He is always the winner

Be ready, the rich people
    And the evil ones alike

There is a penalty prepared
    And it is truly unbearable
Unlike the Heavenly Afterlife of Paradise
    It is full of pain and anguish

So repent for your sins
    Forgive and give your money
Otherwise you may leave Earth
    Only to meet a blazing fire
