Imagine what people have done to succeed
    Think of the lengths they traverse to attain wealth
People have strained themselves for Earthly treasures
    Knowing these treasures disappear when death comes
But the jewels which are eternal never disappear
    And doing good deeds is possible even for the poorest
So traverse those same lengths to attain goodness
    And you will find yourself rich in Heaven

Shall you seek out good word?
    Or do you seek out the words of an orator
Shall you put your thoughts on goodness?
    Or do you think only of what is advantageous
Shall you put work into good deeds?
    Or do you focus solely on your goals
Seek out what is good, and have faith in God's cause
    Then He will grant you all that is needed
