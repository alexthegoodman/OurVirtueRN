Never leave the lost behind
    For darkness is waiting to overtake them

Your Father loves the little birds
    He even gives life to the ants and bees
Consider how much He loves those lost
    Truly, He would give away all His possessions
To fill their hearts with faith

Our Father blesses the one who saves others
    The one who searches and does not stop
    Has the Love of God in his heart

Our hearts ache over those lost and alone
    Their souls are worth more than perfection

So be not above anyone
    Do not fight with the unbelievers

Be understanding, accept them!
    Befriend them!
